Now that you have tackled how to get information in and out of the Arduino using circuits or Serial communication, you are going to look at how you can use code to route that information and make decisions.

We will group decision making into two broad categories: responding to a yes/no question and repeating the same action multiple times. You will use the `if` and `else` commands to ask a question and then respond to the answer and you will use `for` loops to repeat the same lines of code.

The pin diagram is provided again here for your convenience.
