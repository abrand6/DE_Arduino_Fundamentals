Cyber-Physical Systems is a module for both IDE and GID students that occurs over 4 weeks of teaching in the late autumn. As students joining both degrees come from a wide variety of backgrounds - some with no coding or electronics experience and some with extensive experience - these set of lessons are to help introduce some of the key tools and concepts that will be needed. Students who feel they need to spend more time to better grasp these topics will then have time to indepedently work on their skills before the module begins in November.

These lesssons aim to help you to: 
* set up your laptop so that you can program an Arduino board;
* learn the basics of writing code for an Arduino board;
* point you towards further resources to assist with your own design and research.

## Kit Needed
### Laptop
**Operating System - ** Your laptop can run Windows, Mac OS, or Linux. The primary requirement is that it can run the [Arduino IDE Application](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

It is possible to use a Chromebook, but you will need to use the [Arduino Web Editor](https://create.arduino.cc/editor/) and the instructions in the lessons documented below may vary slightly from what works on your machine.

**USB Port - **Your laptop needs to have a USB port. You will connect your Arduino board to your laptop using a USB lead. A USB-C to USB-A lead will be provided in your kit. If your laptop does not have a USB-A port, you need to use an adaptor for your laptop.

The Arduino board has a USB-C connector, so you can use a USB-C cable if your laptop has a USB-C port. **_Make sure that the lead allows for data and not only charging, or you will find yourself frustrated thinking that your board is broken._**
