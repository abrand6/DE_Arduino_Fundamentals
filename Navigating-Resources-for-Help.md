Now that you are familiar with the basics of working with the Arduino platform, you are going to want to learn more about specific topics to support your own design work. Below is some guidance on where you can find different kinds of help.

## Online short courses and tutorials

## eBooks from the Imperial library 
With both eBooks and paper format books, be aware that information can be out of date more easily than in online resources. In particular, the Arduino IDE has released its current version very recently, so most print resources are not going to refer to the current IDE. 

In general, anything published by O'Reilly tends to be a good resource.

There are many more books available than the ones listed below, have a search through the [Imperial library catalogue](https://library-search.imperial.ac.uk/discovery/search?vid=44IMP_INST:ICL_VU1) to find something applicable for your design.
