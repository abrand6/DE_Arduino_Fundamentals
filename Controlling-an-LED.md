We will start by looking at a simple sketch or program for the Arduino. This is what you just uploaded in the previous exercise. This sketch blinks an LED on and off. We'll use it to look at some of the code commands used.

## Tasks
1. Go to the [Arduino example documentation page](https://docs.arduino.cc/built-in-examples/basics/Blink) to read about the `Blink` example. You do not need to add an external LED yet, we will do that at a later stage. Continue to only work with the built-in LED already on the Arduino board.

2. Return to your own `Blink` sketch in the Arduino IDE running on your computer. Find the `delay()` commands in the code - there are two of them.

3. Edit the code so that the LED turns on for 2 seconds and then turns off for half a second.

## Skills Audit
Can you:
- [ ] Edit and re-upload a sketch
- [ ] Change the timing of the blinking of the LED
